# AI Developer Roadmap: Building a Trading Bot


---

## 1. Python for AI Development

**Essential Libraries**:
- `NumPy`: Manipulate arrays, matrix operations, and mathematical functions.
- `pandas`: Work with DataFrames to clean and manipulate financial data.
- `Matplotlib` / `Seaborn`: Visualize market data and model performance.

**Project Task**:
- Collect financial data using APIs like Alpha Vantage or Yahoo Finance.
- Preprocess the data: Create features like moving averages, RSI, MACD.

---

## 2. Machine Learning Basics

**Supervised Learning**:
- **Linear Regression**: Predict asset prices based on historical data.
- **Logistic Regression**: Classify price direction (up/down).
- **Decision Trees & Random Forests**: Use for classification and feature selection.

**Unsupervised Learning**:
- **K-Means Clustering**: Group similar stocks based on behaviors.
- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**: Reduce data dimensions to improve model performance.

**Project Task**:
- Implement basic strategies like **moving average crossover** or **trend following**.
- Build a classification model to predict price movements.

## 3. Time Series Analysis & Feature Engineering

**Time Series Analysis**:
- **AR & ARIMA Models**: Predict prices based on past data.
- **Seasonality & Trends**: Identify patterns in financial data.

**Feature Engineering**:
- **Technical Indicators**: Use SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD for your botâ€™s decision-making.

**Project Task**:
- Implement technical indicator-based features and feed them into your models.
- Train models using the past 60 days of stock data.

---

## 4. Reinforcement Learning

**Reinforcement Learning**:
- **Q-Learning**: Build a Q-learning agent to make trading decisions (buy/sell/hold) based on rewards.
- **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)**: Use neural networks to handle complex states in the market.

**Project Task**:
- Implement a Q-learning agent for autonomous trading decisions.
- Use DQN to optimize performance with more complex market states.

---

## 5. Arbitrage Strategy

**Arbitrage Trading**:
- Learn how to spot price discrepancies across different exchanges (e.g., crypto or stock exchanges).
- **Triangular Arbitrage**: In forex or cryptocurrency, identify pricing mismatches between three currencies.

**Project Task**:
- Implement an arbitrage strategy: Check for price differences between exchanges and execute trades to exploit those differences.
- Monitor price changes in real-time and implement arbitrage with bots that buy and sell across platforms.

---

## 6. Backtesting & Evaluation

**Backtesting Frameworks**:
- Use **Backtrader** or **Zipline** to test strategies on historical data.
- Implement **Risk Management** like stop-loss, take-profit, and position sizing.

**Metrics for Evaluation**:
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Evaluate risk-adjusted returns.
- **Drawdown**: Measure peak-to-trough declines.

**Project Task**:
- Backtest strategies on historical data.
- Optimize performance based on evaluation metrics.

---

## 7. Real-Time Trading & Deployment

**Real-Time Data Integration**:
- Integrate APIs from exchanges like **Alpaca**, **Binance**, or **Coinbase Pro**.

**Deployment**:
- Deploy your bot to a cloud service (AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure).
- Implement monitoring tools for real-time performance.

**Project Task**:
- Set up your bot to trade with real money (starting small).
- Monitor real-time performance and adjust strategies as needed.

---

## 8. Continuous Improvement (Ongoing)

**Model Refinement**:
- Refine models based on new data and advanced techniques like ensemble methods.
- Implement **MLOps** for continuous deployment, monitoring, and management of models in production.

---

## Outcome

By following this roadmap, you'll build an AI-driven trading bot capable of exploiting various strategies, including **arbitrage**, **trend following**, and **market prediction**. You will gain hands-on experience in both AI techniques and financial market analysis.
